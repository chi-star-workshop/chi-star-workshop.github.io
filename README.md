# Website repository for the CHI 2026 Science and Technology for Augmenting Reading (STAR) workshop 

This is a simple single-page responsive website for a workshop. The website is designed to provide information about the workshop and link to a submission form. 

## CFP 

Are you interested in what the future holds for how we read? Then join us at the first CHI workshop on the Science & Technology of Augmented Reading (STAR). Come together with researchers from HCI and AI to think through the questions on our minds about augmented reading, or reading interfaces that alter our texts. We aim to foster discussion on topics including but not limited to: 

To participate, submit a 2--4-page paper in 2-column SIGCHI format at https://chi-star-workshop.github.io/. Submissions are encouraged from junior and senior researchers alike, for ideas across the spectrum from hot takes to proofs of concepts and finished research results. The main requirement of these submissions is that it prepares you with an idea to bring to the workshop. Accepted submissions will be posted or linked in non-archival form on the workshop website.

One author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop and one day of CHI '26. At the workshop itself, you will see and be a part of round-the-room 1-minute lightning talks, followed by speculative design and research activities in small interest groups formed at the event. Groups will be leveled up with brief primer documents on classic theories of reading. We can't wait to see you there!
